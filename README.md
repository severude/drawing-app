## DrawingApp

This page provides a canvas which can be drawn on by red, blue, and black pens.  The width of the pen can be adjusted between narrow and wide using a slider scale.  A clear button allows the canvas to be cleared.  Below the canvas is a RGB color panel for creating new colors to add to the palette.
